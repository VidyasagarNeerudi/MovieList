# MovieList

#INPUT:

The program's input is a predefined array of movie objects, each with a title, genre, and release year. User input is collected by interactions with the user interface, such as picking a genre from the dropdown menu or clicking on a movie card.

#PROCESS:

The fundamental processing takes place within the MovieList component. It keeps track of the movie list's current status as well as the genre picked. When a user selects a genre, the component filters the movie array accordingly. If "All Genres" is selected, no filtering happens. The component also handles the movie click event, prepared to display an alert containing the film's title.


#OUTPUT:

The program's output is mostly visual, appearing in the browser. It shows a list of movie cards, each with the film's title, genre, and release year. The output is dynamically updated based on the genre filter option. Additionally, when a user clicks on a movie card, the program displays an alert with the title of the selected movie.
